     Each crate has the option to only roll specific rarities.
     In this example, it can roll Common and Rare only.
     If we want to specify this, make sure to only set the rarities for the ones you want at the bottom.
     Adding more rarities to what can be rolled is as simple as copy-pasting the template for one rarity and changing the name.

     Each item in the loot pool can also have alternatives, with chances to roll that alternative.
     If you decide to have alternatives, make sure you also fill up AlternativesChances with the proper number of chances.
     If you want no alternatives, just delete both lines.
     
     To actually add an item, the "Type" field must be the internal name of the vanilla item, or "ModName/ModItem".
     "ModName" being, well, the mod's internal name, and "ModItem" being the internal name of the mod item.

                  < -  [ MAKE SURE TO DO "ModName/ModItem", OR IT WILL THROW AN ERROR. ]  - >

     This might be more effort than just writing code, but I feel like it's easier and less tedious, and also gave me json parsing experience.
